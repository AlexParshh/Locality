# Locality

## What is Locality  

**Locality is a platform to promote local businesses during this COVID-19 Pandemic. As many are now relying on online and delivery companies such as Amazon and eBay, local businneses are losing money and shutting down at a much higher rate.**

**The purpose of Locality is to allow users to view and support local businesses. GoFundMe pages of various businesses are embedded on the site, allowing users to donate money for a good cause.**

## Built With

Locality was built with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The APIs we used include, [Radar.io](https://radar.io/product/api), [Google Geolocation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geolocation), [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers), and [Privacy.com](https://developer.privacy.com/docs). 


Heroku makes use of the user's IP address, and via geolocation, returns the user's latitude and longitude. Then, these coordinates go through the Yelp Deep Search API and our custom filters to find relevant local businneses in the nearby area. The locations are sorted by their distance from the user automatically.
