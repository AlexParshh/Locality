# Locality

#Locality is a platform to promote local businesses during this COVID-19 Pandemic. As many are now relying on online and delivery companies such as Amazon and eBay, local businneses are losing money and shutting down at a much higher rate. 

#The purpose of Locality is to allow users to view and support local businesses. GoFundMe pages of various businesses are embedded on the site, allowing users to donate money for a good cause. 

#This web app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. We used the Google Maps API and privacy.com Sandbox API.
